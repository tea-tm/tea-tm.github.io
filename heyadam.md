The Hey Adam! button is a custom "easy button" that started as a combination between a long-running joke and an interest in learning to design custom PCBs and to use integrated circuits. For reliability I ultimately decided to use an Adafruit Soundboard rather than a handmade amp, but the rest of the button was custom-designed and assembled.
