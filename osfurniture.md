"Open-source furniture" is a series of small tables and shelves intended to be easily manufcturable with just a 3d printer, table saw or laser cutter, and drill out of scrap or eco-friendly materials. College students who move frequently often purchase and quickly throw out household items; this project intended to mediate that cost reduce waste by sharing files for easily-customizeable furniture that can be rapidly assembled and disassembled, and if needed, disposed of in a more environmentally-friendly manner than the landfill.
