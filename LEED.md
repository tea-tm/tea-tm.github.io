## Laboratory for Exploratory and Emergent Devices

My work in with LEED focuses on the testing of acoustically-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ADFMR) devices. ADFMR is a type of spectroscopy, similar to NMR. These devices use a piezoelectric material to translate an electric signal into acoustic waves propagating through the material. This is an early-stage project with possible applications in spectroscopy and sensing devices.
