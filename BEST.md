## Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities lab

**Project description:** The BEST lab works with tensegrity robotics: robots made of a combination of rigid and flexible or elastic components held in tension or compression. These robots are lighter, use less energy, and are more resistant to damage from drops or falls than more conventional rigid robotic structures. Modeling the movement of these robots presents a particular challenge, as the components of the robot are highly interconnected and can be extremely complex. My work has focused on a quadruped robot with an actuated tensegrity spine, called Belka. I've designed and prototyped a number of parts on the robot, including the large electronics enclosures (the 'shoulders' and 'hips') and parts of the spine, along with performing testing on the robot's movement.
