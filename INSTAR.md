## Inertial Storage and Recovery Lab (INSTAR)

During 2018 I partcipated in research with UC Berkeley's INSTAR lab, which focuses on increasing the efficiency of hybrid-electric and electric vehicles using inertial energy storage for regenerative breaking. This system uses a mechanical flywheel to temporarily store energy instead of allowing it to disspiate in the breaking process. Without some secondary energy storage, large amounts of breaking energy are lost, since batteries are current-limited and unable to reuptake energy at the rate that it is lost during breaking. The addition of a non-current-limited system of energy storage allows a significant increase in efficiency. My work focused on mechanical design as well as on the battery management system for the lab's test vehicle.
